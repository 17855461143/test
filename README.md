## File Description
* 1_Data aggregation  The directory contains our compiled dye data as well as the collected xanthene  and cyanine datasets.
* 2_MTATFP
  The main code for this project, including training data and code for three types of predictive models.
* 3_GUI
  The user interaction code for Flour-predictor. Once the environment is set up, simply run GUI.py to execute it, and the output data will be saved in the Results folder.
* 4_Single-task_and_ML_models
  Single-task models and machine learning code for comparison with the MTATFP model.


## Creation of the GUI Usage Environment:
* conda create -n dye37 python=3.7
* conda install pytorch==1.13.1 torchvision==0.14.1 torchaudio==0.13.1 pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia
* conda install xlsxwriter
* conda install -c anaconda scikit-learn
* pip install pandas==1.3.0
* pip install dgllife==0.2.8
* pip install rdkit-pypi
* pip install dgl==1.1.2+cu117 -f https://data.dgl.ai/wheels/cu117/repo.html
* pip install packaging
___In GUI.py, jump to the code in attentivefp.py through AttentiveFPGNN, rename copy_edge to copy_e; rename src_mul_edge to u_mul_e. After the installation is complete, you can run it directly___
